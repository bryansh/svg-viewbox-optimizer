# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.2] - 2025-07-21

### Added
- **Event-Triggered Animation Support**:
  - Full support for interactive animation triggers (click, mouseover, focus, touchstart, etc.)
  - Element-based timing support (anim.end, anim.begin)
  - Complex timing expressions (click+0.5s, indefinite)
  - Static analysis approach - no need to actually trigger events
  - Conservative bounds calculation includes all potential animation states

- **External Stylesheet Support**:
  - Automatic inlining of external CSS files referenced via `<link>` elements
  - Recursive processing of `@import` statements within style blocks
  - Path resolution relative to SVG file location

  - Console logging of inlined stylesheets for debugging

### Technical Details
- Enhanced animation timing parser to detect and handle event-based triggers
- Event-triggered animations treated as starting at time 0 for bounds calculation
- Created `StylesheetProcessor` class for preprocessing external CSS references
- External stylesheets converted to inline `<style>` blocks before browser analysis

### Testing

## [1.2.0] - 2025-07-20

### Added
- **Hidden Element Handling**:
  - Automatically excludes elements with `display="none"` from viewBox calculations
  - Excludes elements with `visibility="hidden"` 
  - Excludes elements with `opacity="0"`
  - Supports CSS style-based hiding (inline styles and computed styles)
  - Proper parent inheritance - children of hidden parents are excluded
  - Uses browser's `getComputedStyle()` API for accurate CSS cascade handling

- **Enhanced API**:
  - Added `newViewBox` object with `x`, `y`, `width`, `height` properties for easier programmatic access
  - Maintains backward compatibility with string-based `optimized.viewBox`

### Tests
- Added 6 comprehensive test cases for hidden element scenarios
